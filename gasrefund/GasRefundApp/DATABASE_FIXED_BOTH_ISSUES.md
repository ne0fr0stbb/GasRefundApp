# 🎉 FIXED: Both Database Constraint Issues Resolved!

## ✅ **BOTH ISSUES FIXED:**

### **Issue 1: ✅ FIXED**
- **Error:** `NOT NULL constraint failed: locations.address`
- **Fix:** Added `address` column to locations pre-population SQL

### **Issue 2: ✅ FIXED** 
- **Error:** `NOT NULL constraint failed: vehicles.currentMileage`
- **Fix:** Added `currentMileage` column to vehicles pre-population SQL

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Vehicle Table - Before (BROKEN):**
```sql
INSERT INTO vehicles (vehicleId, description, isActive) VALUES 
('L3274', 'Company Vehicle L3274', 1)
-- Missing currentMileage column!
```

### **Vehicle Table - After (FIXED):**
```sql
INSERT INTO vehicles (vehicleId, description, isActive, currentMileage) VALUES 
('L3274', 'Company Vehicle L3274', 1, 0)
-- ✅ All columns included
```

## 🚀 **Database Changes Applied:**

1. ✅ **Fixed locations SQL** - includes `address` column
2. ✅ **Fixed vehicles SQL** - includes `currentMileage` column  
3. ✅ **Incremented database version** from 1 to 2
4. ✅ **Added fallbackToDestructiveMigration()** - handles schema changes

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

When you run the app:
1. **Room detects version change** (1 → 2)
2. **Destroys old database** (with schema issues)
3. **Creates new database** with correct schema
4. **Runs onCreate callback** with fixed SQL
5. **Pre-populates data correctly**

## 📱 **Next Steps:**

1. **Build and run** your app from Android Studio
2. **Database will recreate automatically** with the version bump
3. **App should launch successfully** with no constraint errors
4. **All pre-loaded data** (locations and vehicle) will be available

## 🔄 **No Manual Action Required:**

- ❌ **No need to clear app data** - version bump handles it
- ❌ **No need to uninstall** - migration handles it
- ✅ **Just run the app** - everything is automatic!

## 🎊 **READY TO GO!**

Your Gas Refund app should now:
- ✅ **Launch without crashes**
- ✅ **Initialize database properly**  
- ✅ **Have all pre-loaded locations**
- ✅ **Have default vehicle L3274**
- ✅ **Be ready to add trips and generate reports**

**Run the app now - it should work perfectly!** 🚀
